        <h2>Multi-Media Data Aggregator Implementation Details</h2>
        <p>The MMDA allows the users to name, annotate, store, and organize collections of data files into data
aggregates called Data-Aggregates (DAGR for short). A DAGR may contain an arbitrary number of multimedia
files, e.g. text documents, images, audio, video, and other previously created DAGRs. The system
should provide functionality for storing, searching and retrieving the DAGR database using the DAGR’s
name, or keywords in their annotation, and other metadata (see below) that is automatically generated
at the time of its creation. Each DAGR must be assigned a Globally Unique Identifier (see Wikipedia)
that can be generated by an online server like http://www.guidgen.com/ or by code that is available on
the Internet such as http://wiki.gigaspaces.com/wiki/display/SBP/Global+ID+Generator, code which you
can run on your machine. The components of the DAGRs are either locally stored files generated from
scratch, or obtained via a web browser (URL), received through e-mail, or other DAGRs. Each of the
DAGR components, including URLs, receives its own GUID which is then linked with the GUID of the
containing DAGR. You can think of a DAGR as a collection component GUIDs some of which reference
local files and some external URLs. A very important feature of a DAGR is that it is light weight. It contains
only references to either local files or URLs to external content. A DAGR does not contain heavy weight
content but still encapsulates all the metadata for materializing the referenced content. This makes a DAGR
very versatile because it can be sent by email or short messages. For transfers, think of it as a variation of
            Dropbox or Filelink.</p>
<p>The MMDA will store and retrieve DAGR metadata using meta-data attributes (document creator/author,
the creation/modification time, the size of the document, but not the complete content of it. When a document
is stored in the MMDA database, a new DAGR is named for the document and can have its own
annotations that describe it. The DAGR database will also capture metadata about DAGRs, creation and
deletion time, creator’s name, and whether or not it contains component DAGRs. Because Multi-media
files may contain references to other files (e.g. an HTML file may contain images, audio, video, and URL
references) it is important to capture the connections between the components of the HTML documents for
maintaining and discovering broken links and other reachability queries.</p>
